#1.Write a for loop which appends the first 1000 numbers to a list 

#Numbers = []
#for i in range (1000):
      #Numbers.append(i)
#print(Numbers)

#2 .Write the same code again, but using list comprehension 

# Numbers = [x for x in range (1000) if x % 1 == 0 ]
#print(Numbers)

#3.Find all of the numbers from 1–1000 that are divisible by 8

#Divison8 = [x for x in range (1000) if x % 8 == 0 ] 
#print(Divison8)

#4.Find all of the numbers from 1–1000 that have a 6 in them

#Num6 = [x for x in range(1,1000) if '6'  in str(x)]
#print(Num6)
